                        NOTE: Four categories of discontinuation are distinguished: a) dropout:
                        Active discontinuation by a subject (also a noun referring to such a
                        discontinued subject); b) investigator initiated discontinuation (e.g., for
                        cause); c) loss to follow-up: cessation of participation without notice or
                        action by the subject; d) sponsor initiated discontinuation. Note that
                        subject discontinuation does not necessarily imply exclusion of subject data
                        from analysis. "Termination of subject" has a history of synonymous use, but
                        is now considered nonstandard. [After ICH E3, section 10.1 and FDA Guidance

                        subject (such as alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine). 2) The Events general
                        observation class captures occurrences or incidents independent of planned
                        study evaluations occurring during the trial (e.g., "adverse events" or
                        "disposition") or prior to the trial (e.g., "medical history"). 3) The
                        Findings general observation class captures the observations resulting from
                        planned evaluations such as observations made during a physical examination,
                        laboratory tests, ECG testing, and sets of individual questions listed on

                        with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on
                        effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug's
                        pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit
                        the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid Phase 2 studies. The

                    <nciodm:CDISCDefinition>The degree to which a psychometric 'instrument' is free
                        from random error either by testing the homogeneity of content on multi-item
                        tests with internal consistency evaluation or testing the degree to which
                        the instrument yields stable scores over time. NOTE: Reliability pertains to
                        questions concerning whether an instrument is accurate, repeatable, and
                        sensitive. Reliability is distinguished from validation, which answers
                        whether the instrument (e.g., questionnaire) actually measure the selected
                        "construct" (latent variable). For example a balance (scale) is easily
                        understood as a possibly valid instrument to measure body weight. Its
                        reliability would be assessed by measuring the sensitivity, repeatability,
                        and accuracy of the balance. The validity of using the balance for a
                        particular purpose could then be established by comparing the measured
                        reliability to the reliability required for that purpose. [After Patrick,

                        Verification usually concerns confirmation that specified requirements have

                        of the complete product. Validation is, "the evaluation of software at the
